This is a collection of programs that motivated me to further my learning in programming. 

I applied my knowledge in Python to automate pump experiments (M6 pump calibration test.py) and data analysis/visualization (matplotlib plotting script.py). As I continued to develop and improve my projects, I knew that I wanted to pursue a career in web development where I can apply my problem-solving skills to create products that have an impact on peoples' lives.
