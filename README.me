This is a collection of programs that motivated me to further my learning in programming. 

In 2022 (found in the "2022 scripts" folder), I applied my knowledge in Python to automate pump experiments (M6 pump calibration test.py) and data analysis/visualization (matplotlib plotting script.py). As I continued to develop and improve my projects, I knew that I wanted to pursue a career in web development where I can apply my problem-solving skills to create products that have an impact on peoples' lives.

In 2023, I developed software that can run experiments and analyze data (FDMG_system_controller v3) by calling functions to control air valves (experiment_sequence_v3) and water valves (tank_water_sequence_v2) to automate an experiment and analyze data from two data capture sources (pandas_data_analysis_graphtec_script_post_auto_v2 and pandas_data_analysis_automation_script_v3). During this time, I was reaching the end of my full stack web development bootcamp and I was able to apply my knowledge from there to write cleaner code with expanded functionality.
