This is a collection of programs that got me deeply motivated to pursue a career in programming. 

As I applied my knowledge in Python to automate pump experiments (M6 pump calibration test.py) and data analysis/visualization (matplotlib plotting script.py) and continued to develop and improve my projects, I knew that web development was a career that I wanted to pursue where I can apply my problem-solving skills to create products that have impact on peoples' lives.
